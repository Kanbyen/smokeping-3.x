Configuration Changes from 2.x
------------------------------

* DYNAMIC hosts are not supported anymore

Hosts with the DYNAMIC keyword are not supported anymore. If you want to
ping a host with a dynamic IP, use a dynamic dns provider to get a stable
dns name to use in your smokeping config. This also removes the dyndir and
smokemail properties from the configuration.

* parents property is gone

The parents property for constructing alternate trees is not supported
anymore. Use m-\S+ properties to provide additional information to the
extopus frontend for organizing your data into trees.

* menuextra is gone

If you want to create links to external resources, you can configure the
frontend to construct them and user m-\S+ properties to provide information.

* imgurl,imgcache are gone

If data has to be saved temporarily, it happens in the 'cachedir'

* pagedir, linkstyle is gone

Data presentation happens in extopus

* sendmail is gone

Smokeping uses the Mail::Sender module to submit mail directly to the
mailserver.

* syslogpriority is gone

The logging priority is inherent in the type of log message. 

* cgiurl is gone

The Smokeping Server does not need this information anymore

* concurrentprobes is gone

Probes do run concurrently

* changecgiprogramname is gone

Things are all based on mojolicious now, this setting does not apply anymore

* tmail is gone

For now tSmoke is not supported anymore. In the future
this functionality may be added into extopus for online viewing.

* Presentation is different

The Presentation section of the configuration file has changed quite a lot
since the data presentation part of smokeping has moved to extopus.
All that is left in this section is some minimal configuration for
influencing the extopus data display.
